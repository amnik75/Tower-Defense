# Tower-Defense

Hi!

Maybe this is a funny game for you.In this game you should prevent enemies to pass the route.Each enemy reach the end your life decreases untill you loose.
Every 5 levels enemies will be changed and became air enemies.There are three kinds of castles 'arrow castle','cannon castle' and 'air castle'.Air castle(blue one) can only kill air enemies and cannon castle kill only earthly enemies and arrow castle(red one) kill both of them.
Every level enemies become stronger but you can upgrade your castles.
